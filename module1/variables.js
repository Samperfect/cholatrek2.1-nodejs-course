//  Variables and Data Types

// A data type, in programming, is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be done on such data.

// PRIMITIVES
// String;
// Number;
// BigInt;
// Boolean;
// Undefined;
// Symbol;
// Null;

// Primitives are data that canâ€™t be regarded as object and have no methods. They are immutable (unchangeable) and they are the building blocks of JavaScript.

// A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence. But one special thing about variables is that their contained values can change.

var num = 'this is a string';

var un;

console.log(un);

console.log(un === null);
